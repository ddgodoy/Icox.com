									out the transitions without disadvantages, one must remember two important ideas:<br /><br />
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin in a simple way but plan a fast growth<br />
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use what you already have as a start point<br /><br />

									infrastructure appropiately planned and executed. An infrastructure that can work 24 hours of the day, the seven 
									days of the week, 365 days of the year and that is ready to make their business more profitable.
